### Full Stack Developer, seriously!

So I came upon a very informative post at [Full Stack Developer Roadmap](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/the-2020-web-developer-roadmap-76503ddfb327 "The 2020 developer roadmap")

So going forward I would be exploring these paths and sharing code examples/learnings.

The topics are as follows
